# Boho Byte Bags
### About this site

Every bag here starts as a small act of devotion — one person, one machine, one piece of fabric turning into something useful and beautiful.

I design and sew boho-inspired tech cases and carry goods that blend color, texture, and purpose. Each piece is built to hold not just your devices, but a bit of your everyday rhythm — the way you move, work, and create.

This site grows the same way the craft does: slowly, honestly, one skill at a time. I’m learning as I go — from first stitches to finer details — and I’m sharing that journey openly.

If you like what you see, come back often. The work will keep changing, refining, and evolving — just like any maker learning their way toward mastery.
