# Prototype 1
## A remembering-how-to-sew project

The ultimate goal of this project is to build a utility belt for my jeans pocket, such that:

1. All the things I like to carry fit mostly in one pocket.

2. They remain stacked top-to-bottom of the pocket, so there's no bulging or weird tangles.

3. Ideally, each item is separately accessible by feel, so i can always pull the right thing out without looking.
